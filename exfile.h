/*
 * Extent files.
 *
 * This modules provides a familiar interface for handling files through an
 * indirection layer of extents, which are contiguous chunks of variable length
 * at arbitrary offsets within a file.  Once an extent file handle is obtained,
 * users may read, write and seek as they do with ordinary files, having the I/O
 * with the underlying file done for them by the extent file implementation. The
 * implementation supports "sparse extents", which are assumed to contain zeros
 * but otherwise have no actual representation in the underlying file; these are
 * denoted by negative offset values.
 *
 * Unlike ordinary files, the size of an extent file is fixed; it is not
 * truncated on open, nor is writing past the extent span allowed. Also, writing
 * to a sparse extent has no effect and will not raise an error.

 * is neither created (if not present) nor truncated (if present) when opened
 * for writing. The function |ex_free|, if not NULL, will be called to
